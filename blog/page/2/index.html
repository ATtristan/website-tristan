<h2><u>DANTESINFERNO - staying imaginative</u></h2>
<p>i finished reading dantes inferno, but. i wont lie. it was too hard of a book. like cmon, i had so much trouble reading through it because its not like i even read that much classics so when he start going on about all of this 1300s stuff and old english poetry and structure ahhh I lost my footing. </p>
<p>but, i think it was ok. it was a decent read, to me the most interesting parts of the text were how modern day media often uses this type of fiction, and I found myself quite excited when I realised that often times the things that we write and create are based off of other things, in a way where our own imagination takes the elements most strong to us and creates off of a foundational tale. Another book I had read, The Knowledge Gene by Lynne Kelly was what catapulted me into a realm of understanding fiction as a form of intelligence. To summarise, the explanations of how cultures historically incorporated tools to construct highly retrievable means of information such as navigation, medicine and other survival strategies with use of their imagination and environment.</p>
<p> I then find myself in awe when I look back, although I do not subscribe to occultism fully, since I do not understand it that much. I do practice alot of utilising my environments as a means of thought experiments, and they arent too uncommon. Tarot cards for instance provide a framework of which to assist an individual in alternatively analysing a question they pose forward, hehe i ended up here because I kinda did the same thing through popmart vending machines (now im down like 300 wtf)</p>
<p> And as I learn more and more about religion I understand how the practices that give strength to our belief in our selves, the imagination and reality we are the sole navigators of, I like it. well. giant yap anyways i doubt theres much substance in here. hope you enjoyed
