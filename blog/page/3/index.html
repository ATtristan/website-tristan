<h2><u>RESTINMOURNING - flashbacks</u></h2>
<p> for my life until this year I had always preached with words how my memory was terrible, then in this year I got sick of playing victim.</p>
<p> it was an absolute struggle trying to conform to university requirements and being able to juggle three textbooks worth of information on top of lectures and everything else I tried to be in between, when I tried to accomplish this objective with a terribly tragic amount of faith in my own abilities of course it all broke down. But after years of complaining it started making less sense to me. Why would I even need to remember this? Why do I want to remember this specific page 91 of one of hundreds of books I'll read in my life? Wouldn't staying stagnant in the information i received ages ago be the opposite of growth?</p>
<p> So I attribute it to anxiety towards my own existance rather than a defficiency in a skill, for instance: why is it if I were restless in night and scared of day, my ability to recall anything traumatic would be so much more vivid than the things I desire to commit to memory? Because it's so much more important to me? who knows. but I think it's clearer to me that alot of things I feel as if I want to remember, dont actually matter, because if they did then I would remember it.</p>
<p> watever, it's all kinda watever anyways.</p>
<p> this book was very sweet, i'd say that due to the nature of the way the book talks to you as if like a teacher, as a student I only sit there to listen and learn. So it's not like I really do have anything to mention about it, rather that; should these lessons prove to stand grounds in my own life, I will trust in myself to recall it when the time comes. I'd like to say im pretty good at dreaming</p>
